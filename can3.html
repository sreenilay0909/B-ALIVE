      <h1>Oral Cancer Overview</h1>
      <p>Oral cancer refers to cancer that develops in any part of the mouth, including the lips, gums, tongue, the lining of the cheeks, the roof of the mouth (hard palate), and the floor of the mouth. It is a significant health concern worldwide, often linked to lifestyle choices, and its early detection is crucial for effective treatment.</p>
  
      <h2>Types of Oral Cancer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma:</strong> The most common type, accounting for about 90% of oral cancers. It starts in the flat cells lining the mouth and throat.</li>
        <li><strong>Salivary Gland Cancer:</strong> Originates in the salivary glands, which produce saliva. This type is rarer and can vary in aggressiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Lymphoma:</strong> A type of cancer that begins in the lymphatic system, which can also occur in the oral cavity.</li>
        <li><strong>Melanoma:</strong> Although more common in the skin, melanoma can develop in the mouth as well, particularly in pigmented lesions.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tobacco Use:</strong> Smoking and using smokeless tobacco products significantly raise the risk of oral cancers.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Heavy drinking is a strong risk factor, especially when combined with tobacco use.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Papillomavirus (HPV):</strong> Certain strains of HPV, particularly HPV-16, are linked to oral cancers, especially oropharyngeal cancers.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Most cases occur in individuals over the age of 40.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun Exposure:</strong> Excessive exposure to sunlight can lead to lip cancer, particularly in fair-skinned individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Oral Hygiene:</strong> Chronic irritation from poorly fitting dentures or oral appliances can increase risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Diet:</strong> A diet low in fruits and vegetables may contribute to the risk.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Symptoms of oral cancer can vary but may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A sore or ulcer in the mouth that does not heal.</li>
        <li>A lump or mass in the mouth or neck.</li>
        <li>Persistent pain or discomfort in the mouth.</li>
        <li>Difficulty swallowing or chewing.</li>
        <li>A change in the voice or hoarseness.</li>
        <li>White or red patches in the mouth.</li>
        <li>Loose teeth or changes in the fit of dentures.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>Diagnosis typically involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinical Examination:</strong> A healthcare provider examines the mouth for any unusual lesions or growths.</li>
        <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> A sample of tissue is taken from the suspicious area for laboratory analysis to determine if cancer cells are present.</li>
        <li><strong>Imaging Tests:</strong> CT scans, MRIs, or X-rays may be used to determine the extent of the cancer and check for spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Treatment options for oral cancer depend on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. Common approaches include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> The primary treatment for most oral cancers, involving the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue. In advanced cases, nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> Often used after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells or as a primary treatment for patients who cannot undergo surgery.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> May be used in combination with surgery and radiation, particularly for advanced or metastatic cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Focuses on specific characteristics of cancer cells, such as particular genetic mutations or proteins.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>Preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of developing oral cancer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid Tobacco:</strong> Quitting smoking and avoiding tobacco products is the most effective way to reduce risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Alcohol:</strong> Reducing alcohol consumption can also lower the risk.</li>
        <li><strong>HPV Vaccination:</strong> The HPV vaccine can protect against the strains of the virus associated with oral cancers.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Diet:</strong> Consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can provide protective benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Dental Check-ups:</strong> Routine dental visits can help detect early signs of oral cancer.</li>
      </ul>
